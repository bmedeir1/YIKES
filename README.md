# YIKES

This Android application was created for a final Matsci Lab II project at JHU. It recieves a bluetooth signal from an HC-05 module and in response, opens a new activity and plays a ringtone. It follows the Android Studio [Bluetooth overview docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth) on how to use the bluetooth api. 



A ready to install APK is available [here](https://github.com/bmedeir1/YIKES/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/debug).
