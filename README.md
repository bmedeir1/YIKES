# YIKES

This Android application was created for a final Matsci Lab II project at JHU. It recieves a bluetooth signal from an HC-05 module and in response, opens a new activity and plays a ringtone. It follows the Android Studio [Bluetooth overview docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth) on how to use the bluetooth api. All credits and rights for those parts of the code go to Android Studio. This is simply a practical application of their overview.  



A ready to install APK is available [here](https://github.com/bmedeir1/YIKES/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/debug).

Code for the Arduino is in a text file under the main directory and linked [here](https://github.com/bmedeir1/YIKES/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/yikes/CodeForArduino).
